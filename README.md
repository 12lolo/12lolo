<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there</h1>, my name is Senne, and online I go by the name 12lolo.

I picked this name when I was six years old and needed to come up with a Roblox username and after all these years I've stuck with it Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.

The fact that you are reading this I find very surprising, considering I have no friends and negative social skills.

You must be one of my classmates who got bored and started wandering around on your computer doing absolutely fuck zero.

If you are not one of my classmates then I am sorry to dissapoint, here you won't find anything interesting.

As a college student trying to get my degree in software engineering, I don't have much free time, and the time that I do get, I spend harassing children in the video game Rust or watching anime.

At the time I am writing this, it is 3 am, and classes start at half-past 8.

Yes, my sleeping schedule is ruined, but I blame it all on the French.

Why? you may ask. Well, I just don't like them.

Also, a fun fact about the French:

they were the first people to ever make a word for surrender, etymons.

Well, that's all from me for now. Maybe I'll get bored another time and update this.

Bye-bye
